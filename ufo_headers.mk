# ufo_headers.mk - copy header files to $(TARGET_OUT_HEADERS)
# which is expected to be ${ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT}/obj/include

# Included from Android.mk

# Use of LOCAL_COPY_HEADERS is semi-deprecated, but very common.

# Inclusion of target all_copied_headers as a pre-requisite invokes the code
# that processes LOCAL_COPY_HEADERS.  Such a prerequisite is not included here,
# as these modules do not have a dependency for which all_copied_headers
# can be made a prerequisite.  Therefore, these modules depend on the use
# of all_copied_headers as a prerequisite elsewhere so that the code to copy
# headers can properly execute with an "mm" command.
